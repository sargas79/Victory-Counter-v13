/**
 * Track state: read, sanitize, mutate, and announce.
 *
 * All shared state lives in a single world-scoped setting holding an array of
 * tracks. Foundry broadcasts world setting updates to every connected client
 * and fires the setting's `onChange` handler there, which is how player
 * screens stay in sync without a custom socket. Only a GM may write, which
 * Foundry also enforces server-side.
 *
 * A track measures itself in one of three modes. A *progress* track counts up
 * toward one target and completes there; there is no failure counter, and a
 * "bad" track is expressed with `type: "negative"`, which changes how it is
 * presented, not how it is counted. A *threshold* track instead starts at a
 * GM-set value, moves up and down between its own bounds, and takes its meaning
 * from the band it currently sits in — it never completes. A *steps* track
 * counts to a target exactly as a progress track does, but each number on the
 * way may carry a name of its own; a name belongs to its number alone and says
 * nothing about the numbers above it, which is what keeps it distinct from a
 * band.
