## [Unreleased]

## [2.2.0] - 2026-09-07

Note: the 2.1.x releases were published without changelog sections of their own.
The threshold-track and Foundry v13 entries below therefore describe work that
first shipped in 2.1.0-2.1.2; they are recorded here because this is the first
release whose notes were written. Everything under *Step tracks* is new in 2.2.0.

### Added

- **Step tracks.** A third mode. *Steps* counts to a target exactly as *Progress*
  does — up from zero, completing there, with a polarity and the same reset — but
  it is drawn as that many discrete steps, and the GM may give up to **10** of
  those steps a name.

  A step label owns **one number**. A track at 4 on a clock labelled at 3 and 6
  has no label at all, because nothing in particular happens at 4. That is the
  whole distinction from a threshold band, which owns every number from its rung
  up to the next one: use thresholds when a number describes a *state*, and steps
  when it marks an *event*.
- **Step label editor.** Its own window per track, reached from **Edit Step
  Labels** on the control panel's track card, and a deliberate twin of the ladder
  editor — edits held in a local draft, written only on Save, rows sorted and
  deduplicated by step on the way in. A label sitting past the track's target is
  flagged as unreachable rather than dropped, so lowering the target never
  destroys wording the GM wrote.
- **Named-step announcements.** Reaching a named step can post a chat card naming
  it and quoting its description, and a single large adjustment reports both the
  step it landed on and the ones it passed on the way. Gated exactly like band
  changes and independently of them: the world setting **Post Progress to Chat**
  is still the master switch, the new per-track **Announce Named Steps** covers
  milestones, and a per-label **Announce This Step** lets one pass in silence.
  Moving between unnamed numbers announces nothing, and rewriting the labels
  announces nothing.
- **Step strip on the HUD.** One pip per step, filled to the current value, with
  the current step outlined and named steps marked and listed by name underneath.
  Deliberately segmented, which is the opposite of the threshold ladder's
  continuous rail and for the mirror-image reason: steps genuinely are equal, and
  bands are not. Past 20 steps the strip falls back to a bar with a tick at each
  named step. Progress rings do not apply and are skipped, as on threshold
  tracks.
- **Per-track "Show Players Every Label".** Off by default, and it governs the
  road *ahead*: players always see the whole strip and always read the name of a
  step already reached — a milestone the party has hit is not a secret, and the
  chat card has to be able to say what just happened — but a name still in front
  of them shows only as a marked pip until the GM turns this on.
- **New API surface:** `setSteps(id, labels)`, `getStep(id)` and
  `toggleStepAnnounce(id)`, plus `MODES.STEPS`. Existing value calls
  (`increase`, `decrease`, `adjust`, `setProgress`, `reset`) work unchanged on
  all three modes.
- **Threshold tracks.** A track now runs in one of two modes. *Progress* is what
  the module has always done: count up from zero to a target and complete there.
  *Thresholds* is new: the track starts at a value the GM sets, moves up **and**
  down between its own minimum and maximum (below zero, if the GM allows it), and
  never completes. Its meaning comes from the band it lands in rather than from a
  finish line, which is what makes it fit standing, reputation, morale, alert
  level and faction disposition — anything that can get better or worse.

  Each threshold track carries up to 12 GM-described bands: a value where the
  band begins, a name, and a description of what it means. The value sits in the
  highest band it has reached. Band **tone** is derived from the track's starting
  value rather than configured — bands below the start read as negative, the band
  containing it is the status quo, bands above it read as positive — so moving
  the start re-reads the whole ladder and there is nothing to tag twice.
- **Band-change announcements.** Crossing into a different band, in either
  direction, can post a chat card naming the band, quoting its description, and
  listing any bands skipped over in a single large adjustment. Crossings are
  detected on the stored band id rather than on the values, so a change that
  stays inside one band is never announced however large it was, and a jump
  across three bands is one announcement with a known destination.

  Announcing is gated three ways, independently: the existing world setting
  **Post Progress to Chat** is still the master switch; the existing per-track
  **Announce in Chat** covers every value change; and the new per-track
  **Announce Band Changes**, plus a per-band **Announce This Band**, cover
  crossings. A change that trips more than one gate posts a single card carrying
  all of it, not one card per gate. Rewriting a ladder announces nothing — the
  scale changing is not the same event as the value moving across it.
- **Threshold ladder editor.** Its own window per track, reached from **Edit
  Thresholds** on the control panel's track card. Edits are held in a local draft
  and written only on Save, so adding or removing a row never commits a
  half-typed ladder, and a mistake is one Cancel away rather than one Undo away.
  Rungs may be entered in any order; they are sorted, deduplicated by value and
  capped on save.
- **Ladder readout on the HUD.** A continuous rail from the track's minimum to
  its maximum with a tick per band, a marker at the current value and a mark
  where the track started. Deliberately not segmented: bands are rarely equal in
  width, and equal segments would misrepresent how far one point moves the
  needle. Progress rings do not apply to threshold tracks and are skipped for
  them even when the world setting is on.
- **Per-track "Show Players Every Threshold".** Off by default: players see their
  current band, its description and the shape of the scale, but not the other
  bands' numbers or descriptions. Turning it on makes the whole ladder public.
- **New API surface:** `MODES`, `setThresholds(id, rungs)`, `getBand(id)` and
  `toggleThresholdAnnounce(id)`. Existing value calls (`increase`, `decrease`,
  `adjust`, `setProgress`, `reset`) work unchanged on both modes.

### Changed

- **Foundry v13 is now supported.** The compatibility floor drops from 14 to 13,
  so one build installs and runs on both generations. No code changed to make
  this work and there is no version branching: every core API the module touches
  landed in v13 and is unchanged in v14 — `ApplicationV2` and
  `HandlebarsApplicationMixin`, `DialogV2.confirm`,
  `foundry.applications.handlebars.loadTemplates`/`renderTemplate`, the
  record-shaped `getSceneControlButtons` contract, `bringToFront`, and the
  settings and chat APIs. The README's *Compatibility* section carries the full
  audit, so the next person to move the floor does not have to re-derive it.

  v12 is deliberately still excluded. The two APIs that set the floor —
  `foundry.applications.handlebars.*` and record-shaped scene controls — are the
  v13 spellings of things that were globals before, and carrying the older
  spellings would mean a shim for a generation that is out of support.
- **Two install tracks per release.** Publishing a release now attaches four
  assets instead of two. `module.json` + `module.zip` are the main track
  (minimum 13, verified 14) and install on either generation. `module-v13.json`
  + `module-v13.zip` are a v13-pinned track that additionally declares
  `maximum: 13`, for GMs who want a build Foundry will never offer as an update
  to a v14 world.

  The pinned compatibility is written into the v13 archive's own `module.json`
  rather than only into the manifest asset, because Foundry keeps the manifest
  it finds inside the archive: a pinned manifest pointing at the shared zip
  would be silently replaced by the shared manifest on install. The v13 build
  number the pinned track claims lives in one place, the `V13_VERIFIED`
  workflow variable.
- **Schema 5.** Purely additive over schema 4: every existing track gains an
  empty `steps` list plus `step`, `announceSteps` and `revealSteps`, none of
  which the progress or threshold modes read. No stored value changes meaning,
  and a track's mode is untouched.
- **Schema 4.** Purely additive over schema 3: every existing track gains
  `mode: "progress"`, which is exactly what it already was, and no stored value
  changes meaning. New fields are `mode`, `start`, `min`, `max`, `thresholds`,
  `band`, `announceThresholds` and `revealLadder`. The migration is versioned and
  idempotent like its predecessors and still writes a one-time verbatim backup
  before the first write.
- **`reset` means "back to the beginning", which is no longer always zero.** A
  progress track still zeroes; a threshold track returns to its starting value,
  and the button reads **Reset to Start** with a confirmation that names it.
- **`current` is no longer floored at zero for every track.** The floor is now
  mode-aware: zero in progress mode exactly as before, and the track's own
  `min` in threshold mode, which may be negative. Both are still enforced in
  `sanitizeTrack`, so every write path continues to funnel through one clamp.
- **A threshold track is always `running`.** `status` is still derived and never
  authored, but a mode with no finish line cannot complete — which is what keeps
  the "reached its target" notification and the completion styling off a track
  that merely climbed to its top band.
- **The bands ladder is kept when a track is switched to progress mode.** The
  unused fields are carried rather than stripped, so flipping mode and back does
  not throw away a ladder the GM wrote.
- **"Announce in Chat" is now a live toggle, not a start-time setting.** The
  flag used to be a checkbox set when adding a track and only re-applied along
  with the rest of a card's configuration via "Apply Changes". It is now its own
  button on every track card that flips announcements on or off immediately, at
  any point in the track's life, and the card shows the current state. The
  checkbox is gone from the "Add a Track" form — new tracks announce by default
  and the GM turns it off whenever they want. Applying other configuration
  changes no longer touches the flag. New API method `toggleAnnounce(id)`;
  `configure(id, {postToChat})` still works for macros.

### Fixed

- **The "maximum tracks reached" warning showed a literal `{max}`.** A GM who
  filled all ten track slots was told "The maximum of {max} tracks is already in
  use" rather than the number. Foundry's `localize` Handlebars helper only routes
  through `game.i18n.format` when it is given hash arguments, and this one call
  passed none, so the placeholder reached the screen verbatim. Long-standing;
  found while checking that every localized string used by the new threshold
  interface resolves.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- **The collapsed HUD has a real header.** The compact stack used to lead with a
  bare 20px strip carrying only the "VP" abbreviation and the expand chevron,
  with no surface of its own; over busy scene art it read as floating controls
  rather than the head of a panel, and nothing marked it as the drag handle it
  already was. The bar now takes the same gradient, shadow and blur as the
  expanded chrome and carries the localized module title, a track count and grip
  dots. The abbreviation kicker is gone, redundant now that the full title shows.
- **Progress steppers on the collapsed chips.** Nudging a track no longer means
  expanding the HUD or opening the control panel mid-scene: on a GM's screen a
  left-click on a chip adds 1 and a right-click removes 1. Chips are GM-gated,
  so a player's chip is unchanged, and adjustments go through `adjustTrack`, so
  clamping, the overshoot rule and chat announcements all apply as usual.
  The chips are keyboard-reachable — `role="button"`, a tab stop, an accessible
  name stating what activation does, and a focus-visible outline; Enter, Space
  and Arrow Up add 1, Arrow Down and Minus remove 1.
- **Per-track "Announce in Chat" option.** Each track now carries its own
  `postToChat` flag, editable in the GM control panel when adding a track and on
  every existing track card. When it is off, progress changes to that track post
  no chat card while other tracks keep announcing. The world setting "Post
  Progress to Chat" still acts as the master switch. Tracks stored before this
  option existed default to on, so behaviour is unchanged until a GM opts out.

### Notes

- 2.0.0 is the first release after the rename in 1.0.5, and the major bump
  records that break: the module id changed, so Foundry treats it as a different
  module and an existing install must be re-pointed at `victory-counter/`.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-08-18

The module is no longer tied to Pathfinder 2e. Nothing about how it works has
changed — the counter never read system data in the first place — but it was
packaged, named and gated as a PF2e module, and it is now none of those things.

### Changed

- **Renamed to `victory-counter`.** The module id, folder and stylesheet drop
  their `pf2e-` prefix, and the title is now just *Victory Counter*. Foundry
  requires the install folder to match the module id, so an existing manual or
  symlinked install must be re-pointed at `victory-counter/`.
- **No game system is declared.** The `relationships.systems` entry requiring
  the PF2e system is gone, so Foundry now offers the module in every world
  rather than only in PF2e ones. That entry was the actual barrier; it was never
  a technical dependency.
- **No game system is detected.** The `setup` hook no longer compares
  `game.system.id` against `"pf2e"` or warns when it differs. There is nothing
  system-specific left for the check to protect, and warning about a supported
  configuration is worse than saying nothing.
- Documentation, the bootstrap failure notice and the debug-log prefix refer to
  the module by its new name.

### Added

- **One-time import from the old module id.** Foundry namespaces settings by
  module id, so the rename would otherwise present every existing world as
  empty. On the first `ready` after upgrading, the GM's client reads the tracks
  stored under `pf2e-victory-counter`, migrates them through the normal schema
  pass and saves them under the new id, reporting how many were carried over.

  The import is deliberately narrow:

  - GM only, and exactly once per world — the latch is recorded even when
    nothing is found, so no world pays for the lookup twice.
  - It never overwrites. A world that already has tracks under the new id keeps
    them and the import is skipped.
  - It never writes to or deletes the old namespace. The `pf2e-victory-counter`
    settings stay in the world database exactly as they were, so reinstalling
    that module recovers the original world unchanged.
  - The imported array is backed up verbatim before it is reshaped, alongside
    the existing pre-schema-3 backup.

  Per-user display preferences (anchor, width, scale, collapsed state) are not
  imported. They are cosmetic, per-client, and set again on first use.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- **The module did not load at all.** A code-scanning autofix merged into `main`
  as part of 1.0.3 added `pointercancel` handling to the HUD resize grip but
  deleted the `});` that closed the `pointerdown` callback. The resulting brace
  imbalance moved `#bindResizeGrip` and `#bindSetInputs` outside the class body,
  making `this.#bindResizeGrip(el)` a reference to an undeclared private name —
  a **parse-time** `SyntaxError`, not a runtime one:

  ```
  Uncaught SyntaxError: Private field '#bindResizeGrip' must be declared in an enclosing class
  ```

  Because the error happened while the ES module was being parsed, nothing in
  the module ever ran: no settings, no scene control buttons, no HUD, no API.
  The brace is restored and the `pointercancel` listener kept, since handling a
  cancelled gesture is a genuine improvement — without it the move listener
  leaks and the width is never persisted.

  No saved data was affected at any point; the module simply never started.

### Changed

- **A broken interface can no longer take down the whole module.** `hooks.js`
  and `api.js` previously imported the two ApplicationV2 subclasses statically,
  which put every part of the module in one failure domain — an unparseable UI
  file stopped `registerHooks()` from running and the module vanished from the
  scene controls with nothing but a console error to work from. Both files now
  load the applications lazily through dynamic `import()`. Settings, state,
  migration, the Token control buttons and the data half of the API keep working
  when a UI module cannot be loaded, and the failure surfaces as an actionable
  notification naming the likely cause instead of silence.
- `module.js` wraps `registerHooks()` so a failure anywhere in the core import
  graph reports itself by name rather than disappearing.
- Verified compatibility raised to Foundry v14.366 (tested against PF2e 8.4.1).

### Notes for reviewers

The regression reached `main` because the autofix commits landed on the release
branch after review and were merged without the module being loaded again. The
new self-test asserts that every private method is declared inside the class
body and that `#bindResizeGrip`'s braces balance, so this specific breakage
cannot merge silently a second time.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-08-17

### Changed

- **Breaking:** a track now measures progress toward a **single target**.
  Failure counters, failure thresholds, failure buttons and the win/loss
  distinction are gone. A track is either *in progress* or *complete*, and it
  completes when `current >= target`.
- **Breaking:** the track schema moved from `successes` / `requiredSuccesses` /
  `failures` / `requiredFailures` / `trackFailures` to `current` / `target` /
  `type`. Saved data is migrated automatically — see *Migration* below.
- **Breaking API:** `addSuccess(id, delta)` is deprecated in favour of
  `increase(id, amount)` / `decrease(id, amount)` / `adjust(id, delta)`;
  `setCounts(id, s, f)` is deprecated in favour of `setProgress(id, value)`.
  Both shims still work and log a one-time console deprecation notice.
  `addFailure()` no longer does anything: it notifies the caller and returns
  `null`. Model a "bad" track as a separate negative track instead.
- Counter labels dropped the word "successes" everywhere a user can see it.
  `2 / 5 Successes` is now `2 / 5`, *Successes Required* is now **Target**, and
  *Add Success* is now **Increase progress by 1**. Screen-reader labels and
  tooltips keep the full sentence; the visible chrome stays terse.
- The default track name changed from "Victory Points" to "Progress Track".
- `--pvc-danger` was replaced by `--pvc-negative` (`#ef7f6e`, 5.81:1 against the
  card surface). Any personal CSS override of `--pvc-danger` needs renaming.

### Added

- **Track polarity.** Every track is **Positive** (the default) or **Negative**,
  stored per track. Negative tracks draw their progress numbers and their ring
  in red instead of white, for every user rather than just the GM. Colour is
  never the only signal: each track also carries an up/down arrow icon, the
  written word *Positive* / *Negative*, a tooltip, and a full screen-reader
  label ("Raise the Alarm, Negative track, 2 of 5").
- **Circular progress rings.** A world setting (*Show Progress Rings*, on by
  default) draws an SVG ring per track with `current / target` in the centre.
  The ring is empty at 0, fills as progress is made, closes and picks up a halo
  at completion, and is clamped to 100% when progress exceeds the target. Pure
  SVG plus CSS — no charting dependency. Turning the setting off restores the
  large figure and horizontal bar.
- **Allow Progress Beyond Target** world setting, off by default. While it is
  off, increasing a completed track is refused with a notification explaining
  how to change it, and a large increase is capped at the target rather than
  overshooting. Decreases are never blocked, so a mis-click stays reversible.
- **Counter Width** client setting plus a drag grip in the HUD's bottom-right
  corner, so each user sizes the HUD to their own screen.
- Versioned, idempotent data migration with a one-time verbatim backup of the
  pre-schema-3 track array, and a migration summary logged in debug mode only.

### Fixed

- **Window resizing and reflow.** The HUD and the control panel now lay their
  track cards out with CSS Grid (`repeat(auto-fill, minmax(…, 1fr))`), so the
  column count follows the available width: one column when narrow, two or
  three when wide. Cards carry `min-width: 0` so long track names truncate
  instead of forcing the grid wider than its container.
- Opening a fourth track no longer forces a scrollbar on its own. Scrolling now
  starts only when the content genuinely reaches the available viewport height,
  and widening the window removes it again.
- The control panel is properly resizable in v14: it opens at 720×660, enforces
  a 380×320 minimum in both CSS and `setPosition()`, and refits itself against
  the viewport after tracks are added or removed — including pulling itself back
  on screen if a stale position left the resize handle out of reach.
- The HUD's resize grip is a sibling of the scrolling card grid rather than a
  child, so it stays reachable with any number of tracks open.
- All animation is suppressed under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`. Nothing in
  the interface depends on motion to be understood.

### Migration

Running 1.0.3 for the first time migrates the world's saved tracks:

| Before (schema 2) | After (schema 3) |
|---|---|
| `successes` | `current` |
| `requiredSuccesses` | `target` |
| *(none)* | `type: "positive"` |
| `failures`, `requiredFailures`, `trackFailures` | preserved under `legacy` |

- Tracks with no stored `type` become **Positive**.
- The migration is idempotent — running it again changes nothing.
- A verbatim copy of the pre-migration array is written once to a hidden
  `legacyBackup` world setting. No existing setting or track record is deleted.
- Malformed or partial records fall back to safe defaults instead of throwing.
- The failure *count* cannot be represented in the new model. It is preserved in
  the data but no longer displayed; recreate it as a Negative track if you were
  using it during an ongoing challenge.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-08-17

### Changed

- **Breaking:** replaced the single active challenge with a list of up to 10
  concurrent, independently named tracks (e.g. "Infiltration Points", "Guard
  Awareness", "Doomsday Device Activation"), each with its own successes,
  failures, thresholds, and win/loss resolution. Existing world data from the
  1.x single-challenge setting is not migrated and will be replaced by an
  empty track list on first load.
- The HUD now renders a stacked list of track cards (one per track the current
  user may see) instead of a single panel; the collapsed state shows one
  compact chip per track.
- The GM control panel now lists every track with inline configuration,
  progress steppers, reordering, per-track player-visibility, reset and end
  controls, plus an "Add Track" form. Undo restores the entire track list to
  its previous snapshot.
- The public API (`game.modules.get("pf2e-victory-counter").api`) is now
  track-aware: `create`, `configure(id, …)`, `addSuccess(id, …)`,
  `addFailure(id, …)`, `setCounts(id, …)`, `reset(id)`, `end(id)`,
  `toggleVisibility(id)`, and `move(id, direction)` replace the old
  single-challenge methods.
- Chat cards are posted per track change and reference that track's name.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- The GM control panel failed to open, logging `Template part "main" must render
  a single HTML element.` The panel template resolved to two or three sibling
  root elements; an ApplicationV2 template part must resolve to exactly one.
  The body is now wrapped in a single container.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added

- Victory Points HUD implementing variant **1a** of the Nocturne design:
  translucent surface, hairline border, grab-handle title bar, large figure over
  target, accent progress bar, outlined actions. GM-only affordances carry the
  accent; everything a player sees is plain.
- Two counters in one HUD — successes (accent, primary) and failures (neutral
  ramp, one step quieter) — each with its own bar, `-` / `+` and a "set" field.
- Collapsed state uses the design's compact bar (variant 1e): kicker, figure,
  thin progress bar, failure readout and an expand chevron.
- Footer log line showing the last change (`+1 Successes 21:14`) and the
  challenge status.
- Draggable HUD: grab the title bar to move it, double-click the bar to snap
  back to the configured anchor. Position is per-user and clamped to the viewport.
- Eye button in the title bar toggles player visibility without opening the panel.
- Success track with a configurable requirement (1-100).
- Optional failure track with its own threshold; reaching it ends the challenge in defeat.
- GM control panel (Token scene controls, sliders icon) to start, reconfigure,
  adjust, reset, undo and end a challenge.
- Per-user overlay preferences: screen anchor, scale, collapse, and local hide.
- Optional chat cards on every progress change, whispered to GMs while the
  challenge is hidden from players.
- Single-level undo for every state change.
- Public API at `game.modules.get("pf2e-victory-counter").api` for macros.
- Full English localization; no player-facing strings are hard-coded in JavaScript.

### Design notes

- Nocturne is a mono-accent system with no danger role. The accent is reserved
  for progress toward victory; the failure counter uses the neutral ramp so it
  reads as pressure without competing. `--pvc-danger` (`#c2705f`) is the single
  sanctioned extension and appears only in the "challenge lost" treatment.
- No web font is fetched. The HUD asks for Inter and falls back to Foundry's UI
  face, so worlds running offline never flash an unstyled counter.
- Icons are Phosphor (MIT), inlined as SVG on `currentColor`, per the design system.

### Notes

- Foundry VTT v14 only. Verified against 14.365.
- The module stores state exclusively in two world-scoped settings. It never
  creates, updates or deletes Actors, Items, Scenes, Journals or any other
  world document.
